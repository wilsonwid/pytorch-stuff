# pytorch-stuff
Repository for me to store all my [public] PyTorch-related files.

If you notice any inconsistencies/errors, feel free to contact me through the email and/or LinkedIn page listed [on my profile page](https://github.com/wilsonwid).

# Table of Contents
1. [Natural Language Processing with PyTorch](https://github.com/wilsonwid/pytorch-stuff/tree/main/nlp-with-pytorch)
   - Data files are sourced from [this book's GitHub repository](https://github.com/delip/PyTorchNLPBook), while the Jupyter notebooks are similar to (but not exactly the same as) the ones found in the repository.

2. [PyTorch Tutorials](https://github.com/wilsonwid/pytorch-stuff/tree/main/pytorch-tutorials)
   - Jupyter notebooks contain code from [PyTorch's official tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/).
